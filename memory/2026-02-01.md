## OpenClaw Config Update
- Enabled memory flush before compaction: `agents.defaults.compaction.memoryFlush.enabled = true`
- Enabled session memory search: `agents.defaults.memorySearch.enabled = true` with sources `["memory", "sessions"]`
- Gateway restarted successfully

## Financial Chatbot - Excel Parser Created
- Analyzed Excel workbook structure:
  - Financial Status sheet: Report Date at B5, merged column headers for financial types
  - Other sheets (Projection, Committed Cost, Accrual, Cash Flow): Sheet name = Financial Type, column headings = Time periods
- Created `excel_parser.py` that converts merged-cell spreadsheets to flat database format:
  - Columns: `Year | Month | Sheet_Name | Financial_Type | Item_Code | Trade | Value`
  - Handles multi-row merged headers by tracing vertically
  - Extracts year/month from Report Date, uses for all sheets
- Test output: 1,120 rows from sample file (Financial Status: 319, Projection: 167, Committed Cost: 197, Accrual: 209, Cash Flow: 228)

## Next Steps
- Integrate parser into financial chatbot for auto-conversion
- Create CSV export functionality
- Add chatbot queries (filter by month, financial type, item code)
